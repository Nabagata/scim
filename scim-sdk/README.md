# scim-sdk

The scim-sdk package contains utilities for interacting with different types of 
SCIM Endpoints, Resources, Schemas, Attributes, Filters, and other objects. 
The `SCIMService` and `SCIMEndpoint` classes provide a starting point for 
connecting to a REST endpoint and issuing queries or invoking SCIM operations 
on existing resources.
