              <h2>Server SDK API Structure</h2>

              <p>
                All of the classes that make up the UnboundID Server SDK reside within the
                <tt>com.unboundid.directory.sdk</tt> package hierarchy.  Immediately below this
                package are sub-packages reflecting the products to which their subordinate
                classes apply.  Those sub-packages are:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>common</code> -- This package contains sub-packages and classes that are
                  applicable to multiple types of products.  Note that this does not necessarily
                  mean that they are applicable to all types of products, but are at least
                  equally applicable to more than one product.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>ds</code> -- This package contains sub-packages and classes that are
                  primarily applicable to the Directory Server.  Note that many of these
                  classes may also be applicable to other products in certain contexts (e.g.,
                  for the Directory Proxy Server when processing operations locally rather than
                  forwarding them on to one or more backend servers).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>proxy</code> -- This package contains sub-packages and classes that are
                  primarily applicable to the Directory Proxy Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>sync</code> -- This package contains sub-packages and classes that are
                  primarily applicable to the Synchronization Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Below each of these product-specific packages are sub-packages providing further
                organization to the classes pertaining to those products.  Those sub-packages
                include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>api</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package are meant to be
                  extended or implemented in order to create server extensions.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>config</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package serve as data
                  types which provide access to information about the server-side configuration
                  for various types of extensions (e.g., the DN of an entry that was used to
                  define an instance of an extension in the server configuration).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>internal</code> -- Classes, interfaces, and annotation types in this
                  package are intended only for internal use in the server SDK itself (e.g., for
                  the purposes of documentation or server-side glue code) and are not intended to
                  be directly accessed by third-party code.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>operation</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package are intended to
                  serve as data types which provide access to information about operation requests
                  and results.  Both read-only and updatable versions of the request and response
                  classes are available for use in different contexts.  This sub-package is only
                  included in the <code>common</code> product package.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>schema</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package are intended to
                  serve as data types which provide access to the server schema.  This sub-package
                  is only included in the <code>common</code> product package.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>scripting</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package are meant to be
                  extended or implemented by extensions written in a dynamic scripting language
                  (limited to Groovy at this time).
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>types</code> -- Classes and interfaces in this package are meant to serve
                  as various data types to use when implementing server extensions.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Annotation Types Used in the Server SDK</h2>

              <p>
                The server SDK defines a number of annotation types that are primarily intended
                for documentation purposes.  They include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.directory.sdk.ds.internal.DirectoryServerExtension</code> --
                  This annotation type indicates that the associated API may be used to create
                  extensions for use in the Directory Server product.  It may include an optional
                  "notes" element that provides information about using the extension in the
                  Directory Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.directory.sdk.proxy.internal.DirectoryProxyServerExtension</code> --
                  This annotation type indicates that the associated API may be used to create
                  extensions for use in the Directory Proxy Server product, at least in some
                  contexts.  The "appliesToLocalContent" element indicates whether the extension
                  will be invoked for operations targeting content local to the Directory Proxy
                  Server itself (e.g., configuration and monitor data).  The
                  "appliesToRemoteContent" element indicates whether the extension will be invoked
                  for operations passing through the Directory Proxy Server to one or more backend
                  servers.  The optional "notes" element may be used to provide additional
                  information about using the extension in the Directory Proxy Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.directory.sdk.sync.internal.SynchronizationServerExtension</code> --
                  This annotation type indicates that the associated API may be used to create
                  extensions for use in the Synchronization Server product, at least in some
                  contexts.  The "appliesToLocalContent" element indicates whether the extension
                  will be invoked for operations targeting content local to the Synchronization
                  Server (e.g., configuration and monitor data).  The
                  "appliesToSynchronizedContent" element indicates whether the extension will be
                  invoked for operations that are used to synchronize content between source and
                  destination repositories.  The optional "notes" element may be used to provide
                  additional information about using the extension in the Synchronization Server.
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The server SDK also makes use of annotation types defined in the UnboundID LDAP
                SDK for Java, which are also primarily intended to help serve as documentation.
                These annotation types include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.util.Extensible</code> -- This annotation type is used to
                  indicate that the associated class or interface may be extended or implemented
                  by third-party code.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.util.NotExtensible</code> -- This annotation type is used to
                  indicate that the associated class or interface is not intended to be extended
                  or implemented by third-party code.  Note that the absence of this annotation
                  type should not be considered implicit permission to extend a non-final class or
                  implement an interface -- it should only be considered permissible to do so if
                  the class or interface is marked with the <tt>Extensible</tt> annotation type.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.util.Mutable</code> -- This annotation type is used to
                  indicate that interacting with objects of the associated type may alter the
                  state of those objects in some way.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.util.NotMutable</code> -- This annotation type is used to
                  indicate that interacting with objects of the associated type will not alter the
                  state of those objects.
                  <br><br>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <code>com.unboundid.util.ThreadSafety</code> -- This annotation type is used to
                  indicate whether objects of the associated type may be considered threadsafe
                  (that is, whether a given object instance may be accessed concurrently by
                  multiple threads without the need for some form of synchronization).
                  <br><br>
                </li>
              </ul>

            <p>
              See the LDAP SDK documentation for additional information about the above annotation
              types.
